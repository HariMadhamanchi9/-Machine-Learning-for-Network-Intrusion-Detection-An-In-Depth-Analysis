# -Machine-Learning-for-Network-Intrusion-Detection-An-In-Depth-Analysis


focused on enhancing network security through advanced machine learning techniques for intrusion detection. The objective was to develop predictive models capable of distinguishing between normal network traffic and various types of attacks. 

I began by curating a dataset comprising normal traffic and 40 distinct attack types, totaling 1,25,973 rows with 41 features. Preprocessing steps involved Analyzing the data, cleansing, finding the frequency of attack type, removing duplicates and null values, followed by data exploration through descriptive statistics and visualizations. Normalization and data encoding techniques were then applied to prepare the data for classification.

Attacks were categorized into binary (normal vs. abnormal) and multi-class (DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probing) scenarios. Supervised machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), were employed for binary classification. For multi-class classification, deep learning techniques such as Relu and softmax activation functions, along with Autoencoding and Decoding, were utilized.

The project concluded with a comprehensive analysis of algorithmic accuracies for each classification scenario, supported by insightful visualizations including pie charts illustrating protocol types and intrusion vs. normal traffic distributions.

This project provided invaluable insights into network security and the pivotal role of machine learning in fortifying digital infrastructures against evolving threats. It sharpened my analytical skills, deepened my understanding of complex datasets, and equipped me with practical knowledge in deploying machine learning for real-world cybersecurity applications.
